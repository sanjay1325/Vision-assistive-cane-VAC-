# Vision Assistive Cane(VAC)
The Vision Assistive Cane project is an innovative assistive technology designed to enhance the independence and safety of individuals with visual impairments.Vision Assistive Cane integrates advanced sensors and connectivity to provide real-time assistance and improve the overall navigation experience for needed people
# About
Traditional white canes serve as mobility aids but lack modern technological features. In response to this limitation, the vision Assistive Cane integrates advanced sensors and connectivity to provide real-time assistance and improve the overall navigation experience for needed people.  The proposed work emphasizes on the cost effectiveness of the smart cane. Existing systems consist of a basic stick or a stick with several sensors and an expensive GPS unit that is difficult for them to carry about and maintain. As technology develops, this smart cane offers a potential way to improve mobility and general quality of life for those with visual impairments since it is lightweight and comfortable to handle.
# Features
* comfortable to use and easy to grip
* lightweight to avoid adding unnecessary weight to the walking stick
* Detects objects within certain range to intimate users
* Produce buzzer sounds to alert the user
# Requirements
* A light wieght cane(Bascially a stick)
* Arduino board
* Ultosonic Sensor
* Buzzer
* Battery(9V)
# System Architecture

# Results and impacts
After conducting functional testing, physical testing, and user testing, the VAC walking stick was found to be accurate and responsive, durable and safe for regular use, and comfortable and easy to usage by people who are  blind.Environmental testing also showed that the walking stick performed well under different temperature and humidity conditions.
